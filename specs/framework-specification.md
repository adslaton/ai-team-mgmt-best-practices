# Specification: AI Team Management Best Practices - Research Consensus

## 1. Overview

This specification details the structure and content requirements for the "AI Team Management Best Practices - Research Consensus" document. The document's purpose is to synthesize research findings into a comprehensive educational framework for development teams transitioning to AI-augmented workflows.

## 2. Core Philosophy

The central theme is the **mental model transformation** required to treat AI as specialized team members rather than just tools. All content derived from this research must adhere to this principle.

## 3. Document Structure

The source document is organized into the following sections:

-   **Executive Summary**: A high-level overview of the research consensus.
-   **Core Consensus**: A detailed explanation of the "AI as Team Members" mental model shift.
-   **Key Framework Components**: The essential educational materials and visual guides needed.
-   **Core Principles Consensus**: The fundamental principles for successful AI implementation.
-   **Required Mindset Shifts**: A summary of the necessary changes in perspective for developers and managers.
-   **Implementation Priority Matrix**: A prioritized list of educational materials to be created.
-   **Success Metrics Framework**: A set of metrics to measure the adoption and quality of AI implementation.
-   **Recommendations for Visual Design**: Guidelines for creating the visual materials.
-   **Conclusion**: A summary of the key takeaways from the research.

## 4. Key Framework Components (Deliverables)

This section outlines the specific educational infographics and guides that need to be created based on the research. These are the primary deliverables.

1.  **Requirements Checklist**: A checklist for defining specifications, success criteria, and resource allocation before engaging AI. **[COMPLETED]**
2.  **"Are You Doing AI Right?" Assessment**: A self-evaluation framework and maturity model. **[COMPLETED]**
3.  **Subagent Orchestration Best Practices**: A guide on task decomposition and agent communication. **[COMPLETED]**
4.  **Spec-Driven Development Guide**: A guide to creating structured, documentation-first AI interactions. **[COMPLETED]**
5.  **Pre-Development Checklist**: A checklist for verifying environment setup, tool availability, and cost estimates. **[COMPLETED]**
6.  **Team Configuration Guide**: A guide for defining agent roles and capabilities. **[COMPLETED]**
7.  **Workflow Integration Map**: A guide for integrating AI into CI/CD pipelines and code review. **[COMPLETED]**
8.  **AI Implementation Opportunities**: A matrix for identifying tasks suitable for AI, including ROI and risk assessment. **[COMPLETED]**

## 5. Core Principles

All content and tools must be designed around these four core principles:

1.  **Task Decomposition**: Break down complex problems into atomic, single-responsibility tasks for individual AI agents.
2.  **Cost Management as Hiring Decisions**: Treat AI agent operational costs with the same rigor as human resource budgeting.
3.  **Automated Quality Assurance**: Implement self-monitoring, validation, and automated testing for all AI-generated outputs.
4.  **Specification-First Development**: Mandate detailed, example-driven specifications with clear context and edge cases before development.

## 6. Implementation and Technical Requirements

-   All visual guides and interactive tools derived from this research must be created as self-contained HTML files with embedded CSS and JavaScript.
-   No external dependencies or build processes are allowed for the `src/` deliverables.
-   The visual design must follow the principles of progressive disclosure, familiar metaphors, and be action-oriented.
-   All interactive tools must provide measurable outcomes and success criteria.
